implementation of Early Stopping
Early stopping is a regularization technique commonly used in the training of deep learning models to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. The basic idea behind early stopping is to monitor the performance of the model on a validation dataset during training and stop the training process once the performance starts to degrade, indicating that further training may lead to overfitting.

# Here's how early stopping typically works:

# Split the Data: 
            The dataset is typically divided into three subsets: training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to monitor performance during training, and the test set is used to evaluate the final, trained model.

# Monitor Validation Performance: 
            During the training process, the model's performance on the validation set is monitored at regular intervals (epochs). This can be done by calculating a performance metric such as accuracy, loss, or any other relevant metric.

# Define a Patience Threshold:
            A patience parameter is set, which represents the number of consecutive epochs with no improvement on the validation set that the training process can tolerate before stopping.

# Early Stopping Criteria: 
            If the performance on the validation set does not improve for a specified number of consecutive epochs (exceeding the patience threshold), the training process is halted, and the model with the best performance on the validation set is typically saved.

By stopping the training process early, before the model starts overfitting the training data, early stopping helps prevent the model from becoming too specialized and improves its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Implementing early stopping in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch involves monitoring the validation performance during training and making decisions based on the defined criteria.
